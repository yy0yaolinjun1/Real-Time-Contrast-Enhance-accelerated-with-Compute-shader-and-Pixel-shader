This is a simple real-time image contrast enhancement project implemented with 
Unity+OpenCV+PixelShader/ComputeShader(unity)

Contrast Enhancement algorithm : Logarithmic transformation Power Law : S = c*log(1+f)

You can click the toggle to choose to run Traditional pixel shader or 
Compute shader to get the result of Image contrastenhancement.(however,FPS nearly the same...)
